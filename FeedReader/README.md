# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## How To Run Project?
 - Clone the repository locally to your computer
 - Open the index.html file on any modern browser
 - Index.html should display the unit and each test associated with it
 - Green has passed
 - Red has failed



## How to Test?
 - Open the feedreader.js file located at spec/feedreader.js
 - Play around with each unit to ensure its testing correctly
 - Or even add your own!
